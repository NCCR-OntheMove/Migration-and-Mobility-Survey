# Migration-and-Mobility-Survey

The Migration-Mobility Survey (MMS) is conducted every two years with the aim of providing valuable data for improving the reception and integration of foreign nationals in Switzerland. The first round of the survey was conducted in fall 2016 on a population of persons born abroad and with a foreign citizenship who have moved to Switzerland in the last ten years. To be eligible for the survey, respondents had to be between the age of 24 and 64 at the time of the survey, and at least 18 years old when they arrived in Switzerland. A total of 5'973 people replied to the questionnaire. The second wave of the MMS was organized in fall 2018 and 7'740 foreigners answered the questionnaire. The last wave of the MMS was conducted in 2020 and 7'393 people replied to the questionnaire. Given the uniqueness of the year in relation to the pandemic, a new section was included with a set of questions on the impact of COVID-19 on different dimensions of the lives of those surveyed.

By sharing their experience in Switzerland, respondents help us raise awareness and contribute to a better understanding of the migration process.

## Topics covered by the survey
The participants were asked about issues such as the migration experience, employment, family configuration, social contacts and links with their countries of origin, as well as their living conditions in Switzerland. The 2018 questionnaire provided the same indicators as in 2016, in order to allow for longitudinal analysis of migration-related issues. In addition, it included specific questions referring to the current research projects of the nccr - on the move.

## About this platform
The aim of this platform is to provide the [NCCR](https://nccr-onthemove.ch/) members, and general audience, an easy way to access, visualize and download the results of the MMS. Users can explore different topics covered by the survey and access the descriptive results for each question. The information can be access in both, absolute and relative terms, and over the basis of weighted or not weighted data. Additionally, in the Crosstables section, users can define the variables to explore and download the resulting outcomes.

This platform grants access to 140 questions of the MMS, more than 500 interactive and downloadable graphs and more than 1000 downloadable tables. This is an online tool for facilitating the knowledge-transfer provided by the NCCR On the Move which aims to complement the already established [NCCR Mobility-Migration indicators](https://indicators.nccr-onthemove.ch/), a series of commented interactive visualizations based on the same survey data.
